Make interfaces for alll of the service communication and load correct instances in App.CreateContainer
	This would also be useful for the unit testing.  Currently the services are treated as a mocked service.

Silverlight SDK and toolkit assemblies are expeceted to be in the default folders of:
	C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Silverlight\v4.0\Toolkit\Apr10\Bin
	C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Silverlight\v4.0\Libraries\Client
	Ideally this would be moved to the project lib folder for consistency

Make an interface for webserviceresults and add it to the container.  There would be a diagnostic implementation for unit test to review what is 
	pushed into the lambdas.
